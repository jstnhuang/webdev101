Web Dev 101
=========

Web Dev 101 was a website that hosted a set of tutorials on HTML and CSS. Every
tutorial included "whiteboards" that users could type HTML/CSS code into and see
the resulting page.

I started this as an officer in CSES at UCSD. I was in the middle of creating a
"v2" of the site but eventually abandoned it.

If anyone wants to pick it up again, the general plan was:
* User accounts / progress tracking
* Site search
* Updated tutorials with HTML5 / CSS3 included
* Reference sheet
* Course page with optional audio lessons and transcript on the top half of the
page, with an editor below.
* Syntax highlighting in code editor
* Ability to save whiteboards to personal user profile
* Ability to create and publish user homepages using the whiteboard editor
* Update user password system to use bcrypt
* Programmatically generate employee profiles on the "about" page

The code here may or may not work fully, but the bulk of v1 should be present,
so at least the tedious job of writing the tutorials is done for you, should you
choose to redo large swaths of the site.

Credit goes to many others who helped build parts of the site: Bulat Bochkariov, 
Patrick Torbett, Alex Rodrigeuz, Beth Yue Shi, Edgardo Leija, Leilani Gilpin,
Justin Wong, Matthew Borger, and others who I might have forgotten.
